I have updated my webpage with some additional functionalities like taking user input for data, their portfolio and also you can get the live location. 
Just need to update my page which will help me to store user location instead od displaying it on the web page.
The data and the input for portfolio taken from user is stored in the spreadsheet.
Here are the links:
