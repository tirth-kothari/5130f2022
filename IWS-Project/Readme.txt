 PROJECT TITLE: ONE CLICK

AIM: It becomes overhead sometimes for user when he/she has to find the best and lowest price for the same product on different websites/applications which 
he/she wants to buy. So as the project name suggests “One Click”, it will compare the price of the same product on different websites in just one click. 
When user will search the particular product on this website, it will show the best and lowest price of the product along with that particular website 
where it is available. This project will include the use of Angular JavaScript and Bootstrap for the website frontend development. Backend development 
will be done using NodeJS, API and Chrome Automation Tool. This Website will not only give best price to the user but also reduce the surfing time of the 
user to surf different websites/applications to compare the best and lowest price of the product.

Technology we’ll be using:
	Frontend: Angular JS, Bootstrap
	Backend: Node JS, APIs, Chrome Automation Tool

Things to overcome:
-	Incorrect data in product feed
-	Under or non-optimized product feed
-	Not mentioning seller ratings
