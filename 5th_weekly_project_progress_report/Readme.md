# Project Progress Report 5

## Objective: 
Gather correct information about the product and compare its price across different websites/retailers so that the customer can surf through good deals easily and effectively. 

## What I did last week: 
I worked on the scraping data from another website. The data is scraped using puppeteer web scraper. (Was still working on the display part of my web page). I had some issue with the end-to-end service after integrating the new code I developed. So was still working on that.

## What I did this week: 
The main components I worked on this week is: 
- Tried to solve the issue of integrating code
- Worked on hosting my website locally
- Tried to solve the issue of memory leak and event max listener
- Worked on the scraping of the BJs retail company’s website  

As there was an issue when I integrated the frontend and backend of my project, so worked on that. Still, there’s an issue while hosting my website locally. (The error message says that there’s a memory leak while hosting it). Also have to figure out the event max listener error which abruptly stops the executed code. Also working on the Fetching the items from the website name BJs retail company and let the scraper evaluate the whole webpage.

Here's the screenshot of fetching the data from bjs.com

## What Next: 
To solve the issue of Memory leak and the max listener error. Once it’s done, need to work on the display part of other websites apart from Amazon. Also to work on the page evaluation of bjs.com website.
