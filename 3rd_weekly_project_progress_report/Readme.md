# Project Progress Report 3

## Objective: 
Gather correct information about the product and compare its price across different websites/retailers so that the customer can surf through good deals easily and effectively. 

## What I did last week: 
I worked on getting the input (from the html page) from the user and pass it as a query to the input for other website called amazon shopping. That query will be executed on amazon.com. Whatever is obtained as a result of the query, is scraped from the amazon website using puppeteer, in order to display it on my website. Was still working on the display part of my web page.

## What I did this week: 
The main components I worked on this week is: 
- Setting up the environment for Backend
- Worked on integration of backend with frontend 
- Successfully displayed the scraped data from Amazon shopping
- Started working on scraping of another website

Last week I worked on scraping the data from Amazon shopping website using puppeteer, this time I worked on displaying the scraped data on my web page. For that, I need to setup the backend environment and integrate it with frontend. So worked on both of them, like setting up environment and integrating it with frontend.

After integration, I was able to successfully display the data on my website. Also integrated the filter component in the project. Still, there’s an issue with span tag (<span>) in display part which I’m still working on. 

## What Next: 
To work on the issue in my display part of my webpage. Start working on scraping of other websites and also to start working on the other modules to increase the functionality.

## Here’s how the webpage looks like:
(Note: The webpage may change as we add other websites and functionalities)
